CREATE EVENT: SETUP
Before you try to run the code or write a similar file remember to set up the directory this way AND:
setup according to :
https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python
Make sure to download the credentials.json file within the same directory of the other two files
AND Make sure while you're setting up, you're doing it from te google account you want to create events to and from 
then run quickstart.py in python3 in the cmd line (to test your account authorization):
python3 quickstart.py

CREATE EVENT: THANK CHRIS
most importantly hug chris for figuring out our encoding issues

CREATE EVENT: IN THE CODE
Make sure you're set up properly!! there's a reason this file is called README
To create an event, edit the createEvent file (like it's a json)
The comments explain a bit of it, but mostly it's not counterintuitive
if you have an issue take it up with eatanoctopussy@ucl.ac.uk (or me)

CREATE EVENT: CMD LINE
first (obvi) cd into the right directory
then run the createEvent in python 3 (this should authorize you to create events to that account's google calendar):
python3 createEvent.py
then add the event:
event()
it'll prompt a function; please type:
createEvent.py

THAT'S IT don't fuck up :)
xx- Alex
